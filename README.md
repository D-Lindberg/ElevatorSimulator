This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Elevator Simulator

A first person point of view that allows the user<br />
to select a floor or floors to visit. the user can<br />
even reopen the door as it is closing! Finally, <br />
as in real life the "close-the-door" button does not work!

## Directions to Run

be sure to change into the directory that contains<br />
package.jsom, public, src, and this README.<br /><br />
then in your terminal, run the following`:`
### `npm install`
### `npm start`


This will run the app in development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Additional Packages:
`styled-Components`

Pictures were sourced from Unsplash.com or Pexels.com and<br />

## Possible Issues:
Depending on your hardware, you may experience minor <br />hiccups in the performance. 

For example, on a Samsung Note10+ using default internet <br />browser, this may include counting every 2 floors but still <br />maintaining a rate of 1 floor per second. 

On an IPhone 10(X) using Safari, you may experience an <br />image loading delay. 

Finally, as tested on an 8yr old laptop, you may experience <br />the image loading delay as well as a minor gap in the buttons <br />lighting up dooring door movements.
